# Looky-Turtle (Object Detection/Tracking Turtlebot)

## Introduction

This is our (Kent Miller/Sam Hamann) CSCI 5551 project for Fall 2017.  It contains code that allows a Turtlebot2 to detect and follow objects.  The objects it detects and follows depends on the model used within the project, but theoretically can be anything (or things) that can be trained to be detected using machine learning techniques.

## What We Have Made

TODO: Fill this out once our robut is up and turtling along

## Why an Object Detector/Tracker

An autonomous robot of this kind is incredibly useful, even one as simple as we have produced in this project.  Some immediate examples jump to mind with a robot capable of doing this:

#### Research
- Visually tracking animals with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
- Generating estimates for population density (of flora/fauna) autonomously
- Autonomous cave exploration and remote study of the biome therein (removing risk to humans physically exploring)

#### Filmography
- Automatic tracking of objects using production-quality filming drones

#### Security
- Machines-as-security for tracking suspicious activity, especially in crowded places where human tracking is difficult or impossible
- Military applications to keep U.S. personnel out of harm's way while tracking suspected hostile forces

These are but a few of the possible applications of this technology.  It is this broad applicability that drove us to pursue this topic of robotics research.

## Challenges

Obviously, if such a useful technology were easy to concoct, it would already be in common use in many fields.  But this is not the case, and we have had the opportunity to learn first hand about some of the challenges involved in creating an autonomous tracking-drone.  Herein, we discuss the hurdles we faced in this project for this class.  These hiccups are smaller versions of those a team of developers would likely face in a real-world application, as our project is a limited implementation with many simplifying assumptions built in.
